    <h1><i>Virtual Selves:</i> Identity in the Digital Realm</h1>
    <h2>Exhibition by Ayat Mughal</h2>
    <p class="exhibition-description">
      Social experiences and their subsequent emotional consequences long reigned as topics of literature and art. 
      Now they take form in the online world in all corners of the internet, existing in passion projects, forum discussions, 
      comments sections, articles, and so on. What exists online can be visited by anyone, anytime, granting a new set of 
      interactions with expressions of human connection.</p>
    <p class="exhibition-description">
    Universal love, friendship, romance, or the many other forms of relationships we live through speak to the complexity 
    that exists between each one of us, albeit most of the time it is invisible. Social interconnection is not so easily 
    contained, however. We seek to immortalize our social lives and our reactions to them in our creations. The internet 
    serves as a space to extend our thoughts and our work, but it can display what exists between us; all the emotions 
    and complexities which keep humanity functioning.</p>

      This exhibition serves to highlight works on interpersonal attachment or means of exploring the metaphorical 
      space between people. In other words, projects centered on human connection are presented online. The following net 
      artworks feature an exploration of the nature of relationships and their translations to the digital world, as well as
      their methods of publication. Different artists focus on the variety of applications an online space offers, and what 
      it means to them and their audience in terms of connection; displays, interactions, and other elements are conjoined to 
      convey unique meanings.</p>

    <h2>Olga Fedorova</h2>
    <p><strong>Will a Vaccine Change My DNA?</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2021</p>

    </a>
  <p><strong>Description: </strong>Olga Fedorova’s work seamlessly aligns with the exhibition theme by exploring how digital 
    technologies and societal narratives reshape our understanding of self. Through her surreal and dystopian digital images, 
    Fedorova examines themes of identity, technology, and human vulnerability in the digital age. Her piece, will a Vaccine 
    Change My DNA? directly engages with modern fears and misinformation, prompting viewers to question the relationship 
    between scientific advancements and their impact on personal identity.
    <br>
    <br>
    By using three-dimensional software to create clinical, detached spaces, Fedorova’s work evokes a dreamlike yet 
    unsettling atmosphere, reflecting the tension between the digital and the physical self. This aligns with the exhibition’s 
    aim of interrogating how individuals construct and perform their identities in virtual environments, where fears, beliefs, 
    and perceptions of the self are often amplified.
    <br>
    <br>
    Fedorova’s art also critiques the commodification and manipulation of identity in the digital world, making it a compelling 
    contribution to the broader discussion of how technology redefines self-representation.</p>
    <br>
  <p><strong>Details: </strong>This digital image serves as a visual metaphor for the fragmentation and reconstruction of 
    identity in a networked world, resonating with the exhibition’s exploration of virtual personas and their intersection with 
    real-world anxieties.</p>

  <h2>Miranda July</h2>
  <p><strong>Somebody</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Year:</strong> 2014</p>

    <a href="https://www.newmuseum.org/exhibition/somebody-a-new-messaging-service-by-miranda-july/">
      <img src="/Users/ayatmughal/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/exhibition/img/image2.webp">
    </a>
  <p><strong>Description: </strong>Miranda July’s Somebody fits seamlessly with the exhibition theme by examining how technology 
    mediates and reshapes personal identity and interpersonal connections. Through this experimental messaging application, 
    July explores how digital tools alter our communication dynamics, turning everyday interactions into performative acts. 
    The app challenges traditional notions of direct messaging by introducing a "stand-in" who physically delivers messages, 
    embodying the sender’s persona.
    <br>
    <br>
    This piece highlights the blurring of boundaries between public and private spheres, as well as between the self and others, 
    aligning with the exhibition’s focus on virtual personas and fragmented realities. By leveraging GPS and user interaction, 
    Somebody reimagines human connection in a digitally driven world, illustrating how technology can simultaneously bring people 
    closer and introduce new layers of impersonality.
    <br>
    <br>
    July’s conceptual framework underscores how technology transforms intimate relationships, reflecting on both the opportunities 
    and absurdities it creates. This aligns perfectly with the exhibition’s exploration of identity, performance, 
    and self-representation in the digital realm, where the virtual and real selves converge and fracture.
</p>
    <br>
  <p><strong>Details: </strong>The Somebody app serves as both a functional tool and a social experiment, prompting participants 
    to reflect on their roles as senders, recipients, and intermediaries in the digital communication ecosystem. It vividly 
    encapsulates the exhibition’s exploration of the ways technology influences the formation and expression of identity.</p>


    <h2>Laura Menchaca Ruiz & Khader U. Handal</h2>
    <p><strong>Walk The Path</strong></p>
    <p><strong>Year:</strong> Ongoing</p>

    <a href="https://palestine.to-be-named.org/Hay-Betl7em/">
      <img src="/Users/ayatmughal/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/exhibition/img/image3.png">
    </a>
  <p><strong>Description: </strong>The project Hay Betl7em aligns profoundly with the exhibition’s exploration of identity in the 
    digital realm by challenging dominant narratives and reconstructing a multifaceted portrayal of Palestinian life. Through 
    short films that highlight everyday individuals in Bethlehem, this work dismantles the "single story" stereotype, inviting 
    viewers to engage with the depth, beauty, and resilience of Palestinian identity as lived and performed in daily life.
    <br>
    <br>
    By collaborating closely with the film participants, Ruiz and Handal ensure that each narrative is authentically co-produced, 
    emphasizing the personal and collective experiences that often go unnoticed by mainstream media. This participatory approach 
    mirrors the exhibition’s theme of digital identity, where interaction and storytelling allow for the convergence of virtual 
    and real-world identities.
    <br>
    <br>
    The films not only document life under occupation but also celebrate the vitality and creativity of the community, 
    embodying the idea that “the ordinary is extraordinary.” This aligns with the exhibition's goal of examining how digital 
    spaces amplify personal stories and create a collective tapestry of self-expression and community steadfastness.
  </p>
    <br>
  <p><strong>Details: </strong>Hay Betl7em utilizes the digital medium to foster a communal archive that redefines identity beyond 
    destruction and despair, focusing instead on hope, connection, and the vibrant nuances of daily life. This work contributes a 
    rich, humanistic perspective to the exhibition’s dialogue on how digital art and media shape our understanding of identity and 
    belonging.</p>
